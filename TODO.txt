WIP
- make my image change based on month (and maybe day?)
- Get another heart! Pref SVG. Figure out colors. Wink!
- loading screen, currently not working the way I want

TODO
- add more particle effects (hearts for Feb, fireworks for Jan, etc.)
- Improve typography (sizing)
- Go back over responsive CSS (probably bad)
- Go back over HTML and remove unneeded junk
- cross-browser compatability testing
- add lil icons where "site under construction" message is (git, linkedin, anything else??)
- AMBITIOUS, but maybe portrait animations eventually?!
- Look into revising portrait sizing, also do I really need the wrap anymore?
- figure out font optimization?
- make sure comments ignored in build
- Look into why particleJS func doesn't work when minified?
- Figure out why jquery gulp doesn't work if using cdn delivery?
- look into debugging svg particle shit
