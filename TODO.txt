- make my image change based on month (and maybe day?)
- add more particle effects (hearts for Feb, fireworks for Jan, etc.)
- Improve typography (sizing)
- Improve responsiveness (more media queries!)
- cross-browser compatability testing\
- add lil icons where "site under construction" message is (git, linkedin, anything else??)
- AMBITIOUS, but maybe animations eventually?!
- Look into revising portrait sizing, also do I really need the wrap anymore?
- add loading screen that defers displaying incomplete content
